=head2 Tadpole is a minimalistic MVC Framework for PHP

Keep in mind: Tadpole is in a very early development stage.

It is build with simplicity in mind so the learning curve is not steep. You just need to know the theory of Models, Views and Controllers. There is no build in ORM. Tadpole uses MDB2 for database access, but it's easy to use other modules. For the templates Tadpole uses Smarty.

=head2 Usage

Just check it out:

 git clone git://github.com/krimdomu/tadpole.git

And run

 cd tadpole
 php script/tadpole.php create YourProject

This will create all the needed skeleton files.
